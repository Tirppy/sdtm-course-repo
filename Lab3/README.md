# Topic: *Behavioral Design Patterns*
------
## Objectives:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. Study and understand the Behavioral Design Patterns.__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. As a continuation of the previous laboratory work, think about what communication between software entities might be involed in your system.__

&ensp; &ensp; __3. Implement some additional functionalities using behavioral design patterns.__

## Theoretical background:
&ensp; &ensp; In software engineering, behavioral design patterns have the purpose of identifying common communication patterns between different software entities. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

&ensp; &ensp; Some examples from this category of design patterns are :

   * Chain of Responsibility
   * Command
   * Interpreter
   * Iterator
   * Mediator
   * Observer
   * Strategy
   
## Main tasks :
&ensp; &ensp; __1. By extending your project, implement at least 1 behavioral design pattern in your project:__
  * The implemented design pattern should help to perform the tasks involved in your system.
  * The behavioral DPs can be integrated into you functionalities alongside the structural ones.
  * There should only be one client for the whole system.
  
&ensp; &ensp; __2. Keep your files grouped (into packages/directories) by their responsibilities (an example project structure):__
  * client;
  * domain;
  * utilities;
  * data(if applies);
  
&ensp; &ensp; __3. Document your work in a separate markdown file according to the requirements presented below (the structure can be extended of course):__
  * Topic of the laboratory work.
  * Author.
  * Introduction/Theory/Motivation.
  * Implementation & Explanation (you can include code snippets as well):
    * Indicate the location of the code snippet.
    * Emphasize the main idea and motivate the usage of the pattern.
  * Results/Screenshots/Conclusions;

## Evaluation :
&ensp; &ensp; __1. The project should be located in the same repository as the previous lab.__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. It is allowed to use libs, but only for facilities like:__
  * Text processing.
  * UI creation (if necessary).
  * Other libs that don't contain implemented DPs and which do not do smth that you can do yourself.
