# Topic: *Structural Design Patterns*
------
## Objectives:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. Study and understand the Structural Design Patterns.__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. As a continuation of the previous laboratory work, think about the functionalities that your system will need to provide to the user.__

&ensp; &ensp; __3. Implement some additional functionalities using structural design patterns.__

## Theoretical background:
&ensp; &ensp; In software engineering, the Structural Design Patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Structural class patterns use inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes/abstractions, but the structural object patterns use composition which is generally a more flexible alternative to inheritance.

&ensp; &ensp; Some examples of from this category of design patterns are:

   * Adapter
   * Bridge
   * Composite
   * Decorator
   * Facade
   * Flyweight
   * Proxy
   
## Main tasks:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. By extending your project, implement atleast 3 structural design patterns in your project:__
  * The implemented design pattern should help to perform the tasks involved in your system.
  * The object creation mechanisms/patterns can now be buried into the functionalities instead of using them into the client.
  * There should only be one client for the whole system.

&ensp; &ensp; __2. Keep your files grouped (into packages/directories) by their responsibilities (an example project structure):__
  * client
  * domain
      * factories
      * builder 
      * models
  * utilities
  * data(if applies)

&ensp; &ensp; __3. Document your work in a separate markdown file according to the requirements presented below (the structure can be extended of course):__
  * Topic of the laboratory work
  * Author
  * Introduction/Theory/Motivation
  * Implementation & Explanation (you can include code snippets as well)
      * Indicate the location of the code snippet
      * Emphasize the main idea and motivate the usage of the pattern
  * Results/Screenshots/Conclusions

## Evaluation :
&ensp; &ensp; __1. The project should be located in the same repository as the previous lab:__
  * Don't use naming conventions based on the Design Patterns or Laboratory Work.
  * You should add an additional .md file / report.
  * For the report please use the provided template (i.e. TEMPLATE.md).

&ensp; &ensp; __2. It is allowed to use third party tools, in order facilities like:__
  * Text processing
  * UI creation (if necessary)
  * Other libs that don't contain implemented DPs and which do not do smth that you can do yourself
  * etc.
